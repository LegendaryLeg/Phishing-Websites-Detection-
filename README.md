# Project Overview 
Our project uses supervised machine learning techniques to classify websites as either phishing or legitimate. By extracting patterns from URLs and HTML content, it builds a predictive model capable of flagging suspicious sites before users fall victim.

# Dataset
We used the dataset from Kaggle. It consists of phishing and legitimate websites with different features: URL, Domain, IsHTTPS, LineOfCode, HasSubmitButton, and a target feature 'label' with 1 representing Legitimate and 0 as Phishing.
